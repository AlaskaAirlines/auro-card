The `<auro-card>` element can be use in a variety of ways, including:

- Content Preview: Cards can be used to provide a preview of content. For example, on a blog, each card could represent
  a post with a title, an excerpt, and a link to read more.
- Navigation: Cards can also serve as navigation elements. Each card could represent a different page or section of the
  website, and clicking on the card would take the user to that section.
- Interactive Elements: Cards can be interactive, with elements like buttons, links, or forms. For example, a card could
  contain a short survey or a sign-up form.
- Product Display: In e-commerce, cards can be used to display products. Each card could contain an image of the
  product, its name, price, and a button to add it to the cart.
- User Profiles: On social media or team pages, cards can be used to display user or team member profiles. Each card
  could contain a photo, name, role, and a brief bio or description.
- Informational Cards: Cards can be used to display information in a more structured way. For example, on a weather app,
  each card could represent a day of the week with the day's weather conditions and temperature.
