`<auro-card>` is
an [HTML custom element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements).
It is a customizable container that can hold many different forms of text or image content.
Consider it a refined framework for presenting images and accompanying blurbs, ideally suited for (but not limited to)
showcasing a curated collection containing an `image`, `title`, `text`, and a `cta` (call to action).

The card details are broken down into `title`, `description`, `cta`, and `disclaimer`.
